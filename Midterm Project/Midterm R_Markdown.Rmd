# 1. Motivation

Air pollution affects **blah blah blah...** and with the increased worsening in climate and air quality, **blah blah blah...**. Our group wanted to explore how air pollution has changed over time and affect countries differently. Specifically, we wanted to analyze how a country's progress can either increase, decrease, or not have observable impact on the affects of air pollution. In laymen terms, does air pollution affect underdeveloped countries disproportionally?

# 2. Data Sources and Data Wrangling

## Data Sources
For our analysis, we will be working with 5 main data sources shown in the table below:

## Data Wrangling
While data from Kaggle are already in a format to be cleaned, downloaded data from United Nations required a little data wrangling. Mainly, we needed to extract just countries' data from the Excel workbooks and into their own contained csv files. Since we only need to do this once and programming it would take significant time to choose the specific cells that we need, we opted to perform this step outside of R and in Excel. Note that if this were a part of a real production data pipeline, we would take the time to program the data extraction but would likely choose a different programming language such as Python that is a bit more robust in these types of tasks like web scraping and data transformations in Pandas.

# 3. Load, Clean, and Inspect Data

## Load Data

```{r 3.1, include=TRUE}
country_codes_df <- read.csv("data/country_codes.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
air_pollution_df <- read.csv("data/death-rates-from-air-pollution.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
gdp_df <- read.csv("data/GDP_annual_growth.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
population_region_df <- read.csv("data/population_in_thousands_region.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

```{r 3.2, include=TRUE}
str(country_codes_df)
```

```{r 3.3, include=TRUE}
str(air_pollution_df)
```

```{r 3.4, include=TRUE}
str(gdp_df)
```

```{r 3.5, include=TRUE}
str(population_region_df)
```

```{r 3.5.1, include=TRUE}
str(world)
```

## Clean Data

First thing that we need to drop unnecessary columns and set datatypes (factor, num, etc.).

### Clean *air_pollution_df*:
```{r 3.6, include=TRUE}
# Remove columns
air_pollution_df_cleaned <- subset(air_pollution_df, select = -c(Indoor.air.pollution..deaths.per.100.000., Outdoor.particulate.matter..deaths.per.100.000., Outdoor.ozone.pollution..deaths.per.100.000.))

# Set datatypes
air_pollution_df_cleaned$Entity = factor(air_pollution_df_cleaned$Entity)
air_pollution_df_cleaned$Code = factor(air_pollution_df_cleaned$Code)
air_pollution_df_cleaned$Year = factor(air_pollution_df_cleaned$Year)

# Rename columns
air_pollution_df_cleaned <- rename(air_pollution_df_cleaned, Country = Entity, ISO.alpha3.code = Code, Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k = Air.pollution..total...deaths.per.100.000.)

str(air_pollution_df_cleaned)
```

### Clean *gdp_df*:
```{r 3.7, include=TRUE}
# Remove columns
gdp_df_cleaned <- subset(gdp_df, select = -c(Indicator.Name, Indicator.Code, X))

# Pivot wide to long dataset (data melt)
gdp_df_cleaned <- gdp_df_cleaned %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("X"), 
    names_to = "Year", 
    values_to = "GDP.USD", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )

# Remove characters from column
gdp_df_cleaned$Year<-gsub("X","",as.character(gdp_df_cleaned$Year))

# Set datatypes
gdp_df_cleaned$Country.Name = factor(gdp_df_cleaned$Country.Name)
gdp_df_cleaned$Country.Code = factor(gdp_df_cleaned$Country.Code)
gdp_df_cleaned$Year = factor(gdp_df_cleaned$Year)

# Rename columns
gdp_df_cleaned <- rename(gdp_df_cleaned, Country = Country.Name, ISO.alpha3.code = Country.Code)

str(gdp_df_cleaned)
```

### Clean *population_region_df*:
```{r 3.8, include=TRUE}
# Remove columns
population_region_df_cleaned <- subset(population_region_df, select = -c(Notes, Type, Parent.code))

# Pivot wide to long dataset (data melt)
population_region_df_cleaned <- population_region_df_cleaned %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("X"), 
    names_to = "Year", 
    values_to = "Population.thousands", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )

# Remove characters from column
population_region_df_cleaned$Year<-gsub("X","",as.character(population_region_df_cleaned$Year))
population_region_df_cleaned <- as.data.frame(apply(population_region_df_cleaned, 2, function(x) gsub("\\s+", "", x))) 

# Set datatypes
population_region_df_cleaned$Country = factor(population_region_df_cleaned$Country)
population_region_df_cleaned$SDGRegion = factor(population_region_df_cleaned$SDGRegion)
population_region_df_cleaned$Country.code = factor(population_region_df_cleaned$Country.code)
population_region_df_cleaned$SubRegion = factor(population_region_df_cleaned$SubRegion)
population_region_df_cleaned$Year = factor(population_region_df_cleaned$Year)
population_region_df_cleaned$Population.thousands = as.numeric(population_region_df_cleaned$Population.thousands)

# Rename columns
population_region_df_cleaned <- rename(population_region_df_cleaned, M49.code = Country.code)

str(population_region_df_cleaned)
```

### Clean *population_region_df*:
```{r 3.9, include=TRUE}
# Set datatypes
country_codes_df$M49.code = factor(country_codes_df$M49.code)
country_codes_df$Country.or.Area = factor(country_codes_df$Country.or.Area)
country_codes_df$ISO.alpha3.code = factor(country_codes_df$ISO.alpha3.code)
country_codes_df$ISO.alpha2.code = factor(country_codes_df$ISO.alpha2.code)

str(country_codes_df)
```

### Clean *world*:
```{r 3.9.5, include=TRUE}
# Set datatypes
world$iso_a2 = factor(world$iso_a2)

# Remove columns
world_df_cleaned <- subset(world, select = c(iso_a2, geom))

str(world_df_cleaned)
```

Note that we only have geometries for 175 countries, some will not be able to be plot on a map but that is okay.

### Final DataFrame Construction
Now let's merge our 4 datasets into one using a series of inner joins using country code and year as keys depending on the specific join. We are using inner joins because we want to drop all null values which would mean either a country does not have a country code or we have more years of data than our smallest year range (the air pollution dataset).

```{r 3.10, include=TRUE}
# Join datasets
final_df <- merge(x = air_pollution_df_cleaned, y = country_codes_df, by = 'ISO.alpha3.code')
final_df <- merge(x = final_df, y = gdp_df_cleaned, by = c('ISO.alpha3.code', 'Year'))
final_df <- merge(x = final_df, y = population_region_df_cleaned, by = c('M49.code', 'Year'))
final_df <- merge(x = final_df, y = world_df_cleaned, by.x = 'ISO.alpha2.code', by.y = 'iso_a2', all.x = TRUE) #left join

# Remove columns
final_df <- subset(final_df, select = -c(Country.or.Area, Country.y, Country))

# Calculate GDP per capita 
final_df$gdp.per.capita <- final_df$GDP.USD / final_df$Population.thousands

str(final_df)
```

Our dataset is finally ready to be analyzed.

# 4. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Quick Plots

Let's start our EDA process by just looking at some quick plots to look at the distribution of data.

### Histogram of Numerical Features
```{r 4.1, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = final_df, aes(x = Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k))  +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Deaths per 100k from Air Polution")
ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = final_df, aes(x = Population.thousands))  +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Population")
ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = final_df, aes(x = gdp.per.capita))  +
  labs(title = "Distribution of GDP per Capita")
```
: *Fig 5,6,7: Histogram of numerical features.*

Looks like *deaths.air.pollution.per.100k*, *population*, and *gdp.per.capita* are not normal and are all right skewed. 

### Boxplot of Numerical Features

Let's look at a boxplot for the outliers.

```{r 4.2, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = final_df,aes(x = SDGRegion, y=Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("SDG Region") +
  ylab("Deaths per 100k from Air Polution") +
  labs(title = "BoxPlot of Deaths per 100k from Air Pollution vs SDG Region") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, size = 5))

```
: *Fig 8: Boxplot of Deaths per 100k from Air Pollution vs SDG Region*

Interesting to note that Australia/New Zealand, Europe, North America seem to have the lowest deaths per 100k from air pollution and are all fairly compactly packed together (low variance) compared to other regions around the world. Let's take another look but at SubRegions. 

```{r 4.3, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = final_df,aes(x = SubRegion, y=Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Sub Regions") +
  ylab("Deaths per 100k from Air Polution") +
  labs(title = "BoxPlot of Deaths per 100k from Air Pollution vs Sub Regions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, size = 4))
```
: *Fig 9: Boxplot of Deaths per 100k from Air Pollution vs Sub Region*

Separating out into an even granular grouping of regions show some trends where Australia/New Zealand, North America, Northern Europe, and Western Europe all have low deaths per 100k and have low variance. Historically, these regions consist of countries that have been considered *'First World'* before our first year of analysis of 1990. We will dig into this more later in our SMART questions.

What do the GDP per capita of these regions look like comparatively? Let's take a look.

```{r 4.4, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = final_df,aes(x = SubRegion, y=gdp.per.capita)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Sub Regions") +
  ylab("GDP per Capita (USD per person)") +
  labs(title = "BoxPlot of GDP per Capita vs Sub Regions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, size = 4))
```
: *Fig 10: Boxplot of GDP per Capita vs Sub Region*

Interesting to observe that the same subregions that have low deaths caused by air pollution also have high GDP per capita comparatively. We will try to see if we can quantify this relationship later on in our main research analysis.
  
### Map of Countries

Plotting maps and maps with intensities will be useful for us to visualize our data and the results of our analysis.

```{r 4.5, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
# Convert to sf object so we can plot it
final_df_sf = st_as_sf(final_df)

# Choose relevant columns
final_df_sf_regions <- subset(final_df_sf, select = c(SDGRegion, SubRegion))
final_df_sf_intensities <- subset(final_df_sf, select = c(gdp.per.capita, Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k, Population.thousands))
```

```{r 4.6, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
plot(final_df_sf_regions)
```
: *Fig 11: Global Map of SDGRegions and SubRegions*

```{r 4.7, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
plot(final_df_sf_intensities)
```
: *Fig 12: Global Intensity Map of Key Numerical Features, 1990 to 2017*

Looks like some inverse correlation between gdp.per.capita and deaths.air.pollution.per.100k.


We can also use ggplot2 to have a bit more control over map plotting.

```{r 4.8, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
g1 = ggplot() + geom_sf(data = final_df_sf, aes(fill = Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k), color = 'black') + scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlGnBu") + coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4283))

g1
```
: *Fig 13: Global Intensity Map of Deaths due to Air Pollution per 100k People, 1990 to 2017*

```{r 4.9, include=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
g2 = ggplot() + geom_sf(data = final_df_sf[final_df_sf$SDGRegion == 'EASTERNANDSOUTH-EASTERNASIA' & final_df_sf$Year == 2017, ], aes(fill = Deaths.Air.Pollution.per.100k), color = 'black') + scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlGnBu") + coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4283))

g2
```
: *Fig 14: Intensity Map of Deaths due to Air Pollution per 100k People in East and Southeastern Asia, 2017*

## SMART Questions

### 1. Is there a relationship between population size and pollution?

### 2. Which countries have the highest and lowest air pollution? How is this related to the region?

### 3. Which years have the lowest and highest pollution?

### 4. How does air pollution increase over time? More specifically, are death rates in recent X amount of years higher than death rates from groups of X years before?


# 5. Main Research Question

## Do lower GDP countries have more deaths per 100k due to air pollution?

### Is there a correlation between GDP per capita and deaths caused by pollution? Is it linear? How strong is the correlation?

### Is there a difference in means of death caused by pollution between low, mid, and high GDP per capita?
